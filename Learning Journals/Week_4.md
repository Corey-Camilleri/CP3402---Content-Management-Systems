# Learning Activities & Resources
After the practical this week, I studied local and deployable Virtual Private Servers (VPS) tools to understand why docker, 
and AWS LightSail is suggested to be used, which has helped me understand the benefits and use cases for both.

# Estimated hours
I have spent around 1 hour of my own time researching docker and AWS LightSail

# Content Insights
Docker is an open-source platform used to build, ship, and run applications inside isolated, lightweight environments. I understand 
that Docker solves the problem of code running different on other machines, by containing the entire application, code, configurations 
and other dependencies in one package.

AWS LightSail is an easy-to-use VPS provider that includes services like compute, storage, databases, and networking, designed for 
developers, small businesses or students that need to quickly launch websites, simple applications, or web servers without complex 
infrastructure management. I used AWS LightSail over AWS EC2 (another VPS by AWS), because AWS LightSail is built for small websites, 
while AWS EC2 is more complex and customisable, used for enterprise applications, complex networking, large-scale systems, and 
high-performance computing.

Combining both Docker for local environment and AWS LightSail for public environment allows the workflow to include local, staging, 
and production, with GitHub and GitHub Actions being a helpful tool for version control, Continuous Integration and Continuous 
Deployment (CI/CD), and automated deployment.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Docker and AWS services like LightSail are heavily used in the industry. Gaining experience and showcasing projects that uses these 
tools could demonstrate to employers that I understand modern development workflow and real-world infrastructure practices.
