# Learning Activities & Resources
After the practical this week, I studied WordPress to learn more about important information, plugins I could use, 
and possible limitations of the site builder, which have helped me understand what I could do with WordPress.

# Estimated hours
I have spent around 1 hour of my own time researching WordPress

# Content Insights
WordPress is a popular free open-sourced Content Management System (CMS) used to create and manage websites without coding, 
powering over 43% of websites. I understand that WordPress is not only for blogging, but can create e-commence, subscription 
plans, and online courses sites, helping local businesses to sell product online.

WordPress has over 45,000 free plugins, and many paid plugins, with each extending the functionality WordPress offers, such 
as adding contact forms (contact form 7), and transform WordPress into a customisable online store (WooCommerce). 

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
WordPress have been used for many high-profile brands such as Microsoft, Meta, LinkedIn, NASA and Target with each site being 
used for different reasons (e-commerce, blog, and digital presence) and each site being unique. Initially after making a site 
using Joomla and WordPress, I thought CMS was limited in the type of site and different structures / customisation that can 
be made. After reviewing sits made by WordPress, I understand the only reason I thought CMS site builders was limited, was 
because I didn’t invest enough time to learn everything, only doing what I need to do for the practical. I need to invest 
more time in learning the software and its capabilities before making assumptions on it.

# Interview Insights
During the interview I always starting with tell me about yourself question and then asked the following questions in any order:
* What grade do you aim to achieve in this subject?
* What is your previous experience working in a group?
* What are your strengths?
* What critical feedback do you often receive?

The starting question was too vague and often took most of the time during the interview and was reworded to be more targeted 
towards hobbies. The questions asked provided more information about the interviewee’s personality, and not much about how 
well they would work in a group. 

Later in the interview process the questions were changed to target quality’s relating to group collaboration, with the new questions being: 
* Tell me about your hobbies? (starting question)
* What is your previous experience working in a group?
* How did you resolve conflict in group projects.
* What strengths have you demonstrated in group collaborations?
* What critical feedback do you often receive from lectures and other group members?

These new questions provided more information about how well they worked in groups but often provided generic / common answers, 
excluding the starting question. The last question about critical feedback wasn’t as effective as I wanted, often people don’t 
know what to say, or provided simple generic responses.

Overall, there wasn’t much unique responses, with only a few standing out, but the time allocated to each interview was very 
short and wasn’t able to ask questions that would take a long time to answer, such as questions that require running through 
an experience / story.
