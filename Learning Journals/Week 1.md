# Learning Activities & Resources
This week I studied W3schools HTML and CSS basics, and review content of previous submissions in Web Design and Development 
to finish a simple website for week 1 practical.

HTML Basic - https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp \
CSS Basic - https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp

# Estimated Hours
I spent around 2 hours revising on html and css

# Content Insights
W3schools was a good revision for creating a simple website, as it helped me relearn and understand the basics of html and css 
coding such as css selectors, common css declarations (display, colour, font), html elements, html attributes and other knowledge 
needed for a standard simple website. This step has made me feel more confident and reduced the need to stop and research while 
coding. I have learnt that html tags are not case sensitive, but are recommended to be lowercase, for stricter document types like XHTML.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After completing the practical, I reflected on the solution used for hosting a website, using GitHub, recognising that later weeks 
will require CMS Website hosting. I experimented with hosting the created website, as it could provide early insights into later content. I 
did learn some things that I would not have learned with guided material, such as I could easily configure my raspberry pi into a 
server that could host a CMS Website, using tools such as Cloudflare (domain), WordPress (CMS), Nginx (server), and using a docker 
(separate projects). This could be very useful for creating future projects and providing a more detailed and hands on experience. 
From the strategy used for this week’s learnings, I have concluded that having initial research before learning the weekly content 
is a approach to learning that could be effective.
